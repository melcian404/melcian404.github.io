## Professional Self-Assessment
  
My name is Melissa Cianfarano. I’m a student for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), and I'm pending graduation in May 2025.

  
When I started this degree, I barely knew how to turn on a computer. The first class I took was an introduction to Python, where we were tasked with creating a text-based game consisting of multiple rooms, collecting objects and storing them in an array, and avoiding a room that leads to sudden death. That class was extremely overwhelming, and I struggled every second of it. Sometimes I wondered if I had made a bad choice and needed to rethink this career plan. However, words cannot describe the euphoric feeling one gets when one finally gets the project running correctly. Suddenly, every struggle you’ve endured has been worth it. I find this degree extremely challenging and so rewarding.

While at SNHU, I’ve become extremely familiar with object-oriented programming concepts, including structure, simplicity, scalability, and portability in code. I understand data structures, algorithms, databases, and security procedures. A constant school standard was coding best practices and following official documentation to adhere to those standards. I’ve gained a deep understanding of programming concepts and fundamentals, including layouts of classes, functions, attributes, variables, looping, algorithms, etc. Understanding fundamental programming concepts will allow me to work with and learn any programming language. I also solidly understood the design of the user interface and user experience (UI/UX). I’ve become well-versed in a scrum agile approach and dealing with stakeholders. 

While working on enhancements to my prior school projects for my Capstone class, I was floored by how far I have come. For instance, the 3D scene. I was extremely proud of the original project, but after reviewing it, I was floored by how much I still wanted to change in the preexisting code. There were errors, unnecessary code, and excessive pieces that took away from the overall organization and readability. The improved code order and comments make the project team-friendly for others to use and work with.  In hindsight, it's neat to be able to look at prior projects and appreciate them for the hard work they were. But it’s even neater to look at those projects and continue to find ways to improve. 

These artifacts were chosen for my portfolio to showcase important skills every software developer should know. I can work with multiple languages and IDEs while creating easy-to-understand code with OOP concepts. I can find and fix errors while debugging a program. I can work with arrays, algorithms, GPUs, databases, UI/UX design implementations, and full-stack development. Getting a bachelor’s degree has given me a well-rounded foundational start, but there is still so much more to explore and dig deeper. 

After I obtain my degree, I’ll push my skills to the limit and create projects that reflect my standards and creativity.  I have many aspirations, certificates, and projects I wish to complete. I want to revisit the text-based Python game idea and create a new one, more of an interactive story. I’d also like to port that into a couple of different languages. There are some Android Studio apps I would like to make. I want to create a new 3D scene to have a realistic castle. As for certificates, I’ll be following the AWS software developer path and the AWS AI path. I also want to complete the Oracle Java certifications, the certified scrum developer certification, a CompTIA, CAPM, and I’m sure the list of goals will continue. After personal development, I’ll revisit obtaining a master’s degree.
